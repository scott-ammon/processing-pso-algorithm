# processing-pso-algorithm

I decided to take on learning some basic functionality of Processing, and wrote
this code in 2014 as a side project to implement an algorithm I was taught during
my graduate degree in Naval Architecture. This was a really fun way to get to know
some of the basic plotting in Processing, and keep up my scripting skills on the side.
